SLC25A10: Mechanistic Ping–Pong Model, Simulation & Bayesian Inference

This repository contains a fully reproducible workflow for a mechanistically derived, thermodynamically consistent model of the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier SLC25A10 (DIC). It includes:

Deterministic ODE simulations of heteroexchange (malate/succinate ↔ phosphate) under physiological and perturbed conditions,

Thermodynamic validation (ΔG, equilibrium checks),

Bayesian parameter estimation via MCMC,

Volume–flux analyses (IMS/matrix swelling) and SDH/SCAS coupling scenarios,

Figure-generation scripts matching the results in the manuscript.

Highlights: single-site ping–pong mechanism, competitive binding (malate vs succinate), conformational bias weights (λ₍₂₁₎, λ₍₃₁₎), electroneutral 1:1 exchange, and morphology-dependent flux modulation.
